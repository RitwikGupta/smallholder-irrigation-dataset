    Parses an XML file to extract site-level and day-level irrigation data.
    Args:
        file_path (str): The file path to the XML file to be parsed.
    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the following keys:
            - site_id (str or None): The site ID extracted from the XML.
            - internal_id (int): The internal ID derived from the filename (without extension).
            - plot_file (str or None): The plot file value from the XML.
            - operator (str or None): The operator value from the XML.
            - operator_initials (str): The initials of the operator, derived from the file path.
            - x (str or None): The x-coordinate of the location from the XML.
            - y (str or None): The y-coordinate of the location from the XML.
            - water_source (str or None): The water source value from the XML.
            - image_number (int): The image number (1 to 10) corresponding to the day record.
            - year (str or None): The year value for the day record.
            - month (str or None): The month value for the day record.
            - day (str or None): The day value for the day record.
            - irrigation (str or None): The irrigation value for the day record.
    Notes:
        - The function assumes that the XML file contains up to 10 day records, each with fields
          such as year, month, day, and irrigation.
        - If a field is missing or not found in the XML, its value will be set to None.
        - The operator initials are extracted from the file path by splitting the directory name
          preceding the file name.
