This interactive platform allows researchers and decision-makers to explore field-labeled irrigation data collected across Zambia.

## What this app shows:

- Locations of manually labeled irrigation sites (via Google Earth and Earth Collect)
- Certainty scores and metadata about each observation
- Interactive map, filterable data table, and sample imagery

Data labeling was conducted during the dry season using high-resolution satellite imagery and field protocols documented in our labeling guide.
