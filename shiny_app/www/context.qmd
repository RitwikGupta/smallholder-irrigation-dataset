This dataset was created by manually labeling 1,000 satellite images in Google Earth Pro using EarthCollect. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| out.width: "80%"
#| out.height: "auto"

knitr::include_graphics(c(
  here::here("shiny_app", "www", "labelingex1.png"),
  here::here("shiny_app", "www", "labelingex2.png"),
  here::here("shiny_app", "www", "labelingex3.png")
))

## Irrigation 101
There are various levels of irrigation depending on the infrastructure's sophistication. Also, irrigation requires three things to be effective: a water source, water transportation and water distribution. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "100%"
#| out.height: "auto"

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("shiny_app","www","irrigationdiagram.png"))
```


## Labeling Process
Each image was evaluated for:

- Irrigation presence (certainty score 1â€“5)
- Percent cover of irrigated area
- Water source (stream, borehole, etc.)
